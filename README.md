# vid-compress  

### An app for compressing videos with FFmpeg embedded.  
### !!! (Work In Process) !!!
The project is still being finished. It has basic functionality but it's still not done yet.  
I recommend waiting for the first release.

##

**Supported codecs:** libx264  
(Might add libx265 later)
